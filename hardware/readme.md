### Building  
#### 1. Main PCB  
KiCad project is provided in the `KiCad_proj/MainBoard` folder.  
The main PCB is a 4 layer one. A zip file with Gerbers is included and can be used to order a set of the boards. I do recommend ordering a stencil for the bottom layer.

Interactive HTML BOM is available and will help with hand placing the components. Most of the passives are 0805 and larger.

There are various jumpers included on the main PCB. They are pre-set for default configuration.
1. **CLIP SELECT** The AK5552 ADC has an input signal clip indicator which is used to drive the red part of the SignalPresence/Clip indicator. This might not be the case for other codecs/ADCs. Signal Clip line can be also driven directly from Teensy's **GPIO34**. To enable it the jumper has to be bridged. Default source is the ADC.  
2. **ADC MASTER/SLAVE** selector. Default setting is Slave - Teensy generates all the required I2S clocks.  
3. **ADC ADDR** I2C address used to configure the AK5552 chip.  
4. **DAC ADDR** I2C address used to configure the AK4452 chip. 
5. **13/36** near the display connector. Footswitch signals are routed to the ESP32S2 board, one can be swapped for the GPIO36 and used for other tasks.  
6. **EXPSNS=A0|14** Expression pedal detection is routed to GPIO14 (default). To free the GPIO14 when no expression pedal is used, make the jumper open.  
7. **EXP=A1|15**  Expression pedal signal. By default routed to GPIO15 (jumper closed).  
8. **10k PULL-UP** a test point providing a 10k 3.3V pull up resistor in case it's needed. 

Top layer are mainly through-hole components, except the USB-C connector for the Teensy and the LEDs.

### Caution!  
<h2><span style="color:red;">While connecting the Teensy and the ESP32 to the USB sockets leave the VBUS 5V wire disconnected!</span></h2>

#### 2. Making the enclosure  
See [>>>> here <<<<](enclosure.md).  

### Front Panel  
Front panel as KicaD PCB project, including gerbers is available in the `KiCad_proj/FrontPanel` folder.

### Display  
The ESP32S3 + Touch display board used in this project is the WT32SC01Plus. There are many variants of the ESP32+display boards floating around, here are the specs of the used one:
